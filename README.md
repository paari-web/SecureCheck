Real-time Monitoring Systems




Problem Statement:
Police check posts require a centralized system for logging, tracking, and analyzing vehicle movements. Currently, manual logging and inefficient databases slow down security processes. This project aims to build an SQL-based check post database with a Python-powered dashboard for real-time insights and alerts.
Business Use Cases:
Real-time logging of vehicles and personnel.
Automated suspect vehicle identification using SQL queries.
Check post efficiency monitoring through data analytics.
Crime pattern analysis with Python scripts.
Centralized database for multi-location check posts.




Approach:
Data Collection & Storage
Define SQL schema for police stop records.
Store data in PostgreSQL/MySQL.
Use Python (pandas, sqlalchemy) to insert and query data.
Step 1: Python for Data Processing
Remove the columns that only contains missing value
Handle the NAN values 
Step 2: Database Design (SQL)
Tables: Example(Create one table and  insert that values into sql)
Step 3: Streamlit Dashboard
Display vehicle logs, violations, and officer reports.
Implement SQL-based search filters for quick lookups.
Generate analytics and trends (e.g., high-risk vehicles).



        Example:
üöó A 27-year-old male driver was stopped  for Speeding at 2:30 PM. No search was conducted, and he received a citation. The stop lasted 6-15 minutes and was not drug-related.


Results: 
Faster check post operations using SQL queries.
Automated alerts for flagged vehicles.
Real-time reporting of security violations.
Data-backed decision-making for law enforcement.



Project Evaluation metrics:
Query Execution Time: Optimize SQL queries for fast lookups.
Data Accuracy: Ensure correct log entries and flagged reports.
System Uptime: Real-time updates without lag.
User Engagement: Officers‚Äô interaction with the system.
Violation Detection Rate: Percentage of flagged vehicles identified.

SQL QUERIES :
(Medium level):
üöó Vehicle-Based
     1.What are the top 10 vehicle_Number involved in drug-related stops?


Which vehicles were most frequently searched?


üßç Demographic-Based
Which driver age group had the highest arrest rate?


What is the gender distribution of drivers stopped in each country?


Which race and gender combination has the highest search rate?


üïí Time & Duration Based
What time of day sees the most traffic stops?


What is the average stop duration for different violations?


Are stops during the night more likely to lead to arrests?


‚öñÔ∏è Violation-Based
Which violations are most associated with searches or arrests?


Which violations are most common among younger drivers (<25)?


Is there a violation that rarely results in search or arrest?


üåç Location-Based
Which countries report the highest rate of drug-related stops?


What is the arrest rate by country and violation?


Which country has the most stops with search conducted?
(Complex): 
1.Yearly Breakdown of Stops and Arrests by Country (Using Subquery and Window Functions)
2.Driver Violation Trends Based on Age and Race (Join with Subquery)
3.Time Period Analysis of Stops (Joining with Date Functions) , Number of Stops by Year,Month, Hour of the Day
4.Violations with High Search and Arrest Rates (Window Function)
5.Driver Demographics by Country (Age, Gender, and Race)
6.Top 5 Violations with Highest Arrest Rates
